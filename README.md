Unreal Turnoment 2004 Steam Deck Config Files
=============================================

These are my changes to my UT2004 config files for better steam deck support.
For now, the main fix is the overly sensitive mouse input on menu screens.

To use, replace the UT2004.ini and User.ini files stored at 
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Unreal Turnoment 2004/System
